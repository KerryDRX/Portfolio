  # Evidential Deep Learning Loss Functions

</div>

## Overview

- Implementation of evidential deep learning loss functions based on Bayes risk of traditional deep learning loss functions.
- Tasks include classification, 2D segmentation, 3D segmentation, and regression.
- Details of mathematical derivations will be made available upon paper acceptance.

## Getting Started

- Set configurations in `config.py`.
- Train the model in `train.py`.
- Visualize results in `visualize.ipynb` if implemented.
