  # Statistical Shape Modeling

</div>

## Overview

- This repository contains partial code to build statistical shape models for brain ventricles and quantify shape uncertainty.
- The ultimate goal of this project is to integrate shape information in deep segmentation neural network training.
- The complete code will be updated by the time the work is finished.
